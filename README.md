# Hi, I'm Rebecca

Hey there! I'm an SRE working on Really Cool Stuff. Unfortunately, due to this, the time
I have to dedicate to maintaining personal projects is limited. I try when I can, but
this can get difficult.

## Interaction Details
I've got horrible social anxiety, so treat me like a scared dog. I'm very enthusiastic
when I'm familiar with someone or a community, but it does take me a while to warm up
to them, so please be patient!

## Private Repositories
You can't see these directly, but if I recall correctly, you may be able to see the little
green squares. I may appear to be making lots of commits in private repos, but in reality
what you're probably seeing is my note-taking repository. Sorry, it's nothing interesting
or secret.

## Public Repositories
Any of my public repos are totally available for PRs, so if you see an error or want to
rework some code I wrote a while ago because it's useful for you, please feel free to
fork it and send along a PR!

I do ask that you put a short summary of your changes in any PRs you send along, and
consider that some of the tools I have may be designed to be simple with minimal knobs.
